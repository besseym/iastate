<h3>Day and Night</h3>
<p>During the day I am divided
and eaten. </p>
<p>There are pieces of me
which are snatched by common needs,
devoured by strange hungers.</p>
<p>I am dispersed,
and myself I do not know.</p>
<p>I become the world's property, 
of those whose words hurt and those
whose silence borrows speech from me.</p>
<p>My own path may have other aims,
but they wander into other people's dreams,
and sometimes, they cross frontiers
where skies heave like mountains
being born.</p>
<p>Given everywhere and taking all,
I am purely spent -
both gifts and their bright wrappings
set aside and forgotten.</p>
<p>Then at night my dream gathers
my pieces like minnows in a stream,
and I am returned to myself
where my words sleep and cannot shape
thoughts to unravel me.</p>
