<h3>Night and Day</h3>
<p>When the golden day is done, Through the closing portal, 
Child and garden, Flower and sun, 
Vanish all things mortal. </p>

<p>As the blinding shadows fall 
As the rays diminish, 
Under evening's cloak they all 
Roll away and vanish.</p>

<p>Garden darkened, daisy shut, 
Child in bed, they slumber-- 
Glow-worm in the hallway rut, 
Mice among the lumber. </p>

<p>In the darkness houses shine, 
Parents move the candles; 
Till on all the night divine 
Turns the bedroom handles. </p>

<p>Till at last the day begins 
In the east a-breaking, 
In the hedges and the whins 
Sleeping birds a-waking. </p>

<p>In the darkness shapes of things, 
Houses, trees and hedges, 
Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings 
Beat on window ledges. </p>

<p>These shall wake the yawning maid; 
She the door shall open-- 
Finding dew on garden glade 
And the morning broken. </p>

<p>There my garden grows again 
Green and rosy painted, 
As at eve behind the pane 
From my eyes it fainted. </p>

<p>Just as it was shut away, 
Toy-like, in the even, 
Here I see it glow with day 
Under glowing heaven. </p>

<p>Every path and every plot, 
Every blush of roses, 
Every blue forget-me-not 
Where the dew reposes, </p>

<p>"Up!" they cry, "the day is come 
On the smiling valleys: 
We have beat the morning drum; 
Playmate, join your allies!"</p>
