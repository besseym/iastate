	<h6>Assumptions</h6>
	<p>Dr. Bob is technically proficient and has many demands on his time. Dr. Bob is a professor for advanced studies in the sciences and has found that traditional classroom methods such as simple multiple choice or short answer questions are not sufficient for teaching deep underlying concepts and how to deal with real-world problems. Dr. Bob realizes that, in order to prepare students for what they will encounter when they enter the professional world, students must be taught to find solutions to problems that are ambiguous or ill-defined and can potentially have multiple solutions.</p>
	
	<p>Also, Dr. Bob finds that, while evaluating the work of his students, he is often providing the same general comments and feedback statements. Dr. Bob would like a system in which he could easily recall and reuse feedback statements within student evaluations.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, as a result of his research in the methods of instruction for the sciences Dr. Bob is often the recipient of federal grant money and because Dr. Bob sees the potential in ThinkSpace to provide a flexible and collaborative learning environment he wishes to use his grant money to propose enhancements to ThinkSpace that will help him put his research into practice.</p>

	</ul>
	
	<p>Dr. Bob is technically proficient in which he is open to and not easily discouraged in learning new technologies, but because he has many demands on his time he prefers to use an interface that is intuitive and easy to understand. He prefers technology that he can quickly assess on how it would benefit his workflow and objectives. Dr. Bob is constantly thinking about how to make the grading process more efficient and likes using features within software that automate tedious tasks for him and saves him time.</p>
	
	<p>Dr. Bob is familiar with using rubrics to evaluate assignments and is more interested in assessing a student's decision making ability when attempting to solving a complex problem that represent problems found in the real-world rather than assessing a student's ability to recycle facts through multiple choice and short answer questions. Dr. Bob finds that his greatest challenge is to get students to think at a deep level. He feels that reflection and critical thinking are always difficult for students.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, Dr. Bob likes using ThinkSpace because it provides one place for Students to communicate, collaborate on assignments and store past assignments. Dr. Bob sees potential in ThinkSpace and would use his grant money towards enhancements of ThinkSpace that would allow him to put his research into practice. Dr. Bob would, specifically, like to see ThinkSpace improved with a more consistent and intuitive user interface.</p>
