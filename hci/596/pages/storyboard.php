<h5>Rubric Creation Process Storyboard Steps after the UCD Process</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Dr. Bob is interested in creating an ambiguous and ill-defined assignment that models a problem in the real world. He wants his students to think at a deep level by using reflection and critical thinking.</li>
	<li>Dr. Bob creates this assignment within ThinkSpace because it provides one place for Students to communicate, collaborate on assignments and store past assignments.</li>
	<li>Because Dr. Bob is familiar with the benefit rubrics provide in evaluating assignments and communicating assessment feedback to students, he uses the rubric feature within ThinkSpace to create a customized rubric.</li>
	<li>First Dr. Bob logs into ThinkSpace and selects the assignment for the new Rubric.</li>
	<li>At the assignment level, he clicks the "Rubrics" button to bring up the Rubric editor.</li>
	<li>When the rubric editor comes up Dr. Bob wishes that the rubric creation process was all contained in one screen instead of broken up into multiple steps as a wizard.</li>
	<li>Dr. Bob creates a new Rubric and gives the rubric a Minimum and Maximum point value.</li>
	<li>When defining the range for the achievement levels Dr. Bob prefers to keep the scale
	small. He finds that when working with a large scale it provides too much granularity and
	produces a graph that is confusing to decipher. This graph also wastes space because
	most students do better than 50% within a category. Dr. Bob finds that a scale from 1 to
	7 is optimal.</li>
	<li>Due to the complicated nature of the assignment there will be multiple categories on which to assess students each category with different levels of achievement.</li>
	<li>After creating the categories Dr. Bob wishes that he could create sub-categories within each category.</li>
	<li>Dr. Bob defines three levels that a student can achieve within each category.</li>
	<li>Dr. Bob finds it tedious to define a description at each achievement level for each category. The level descriptions within each category is good feedback to the students but often they don't understand specifically why they fall at that level within that category. </li>
	<li>What Dr. Bob likes best about using the ThinksSpace Rubric is its ability to generate a report during the grading process. He likes the unique interface with the sliders which allows the grader to specify what score the student receives within a category.</li>
	<li>When generating the grading report Dr. Bob wishes that he could provide the student with specific feedback statements based on common mistakes. He wishes that a version of the Markup tool was available when generating a rubric report.</li>
	<li>Dr. Bob decides to provide the rubric to his students as a mechanism for self assessment.</li>
