<h4>Play IT Project</h4>
<h5>Educational Experiences for Children with Autism to Mediate Social and Educational Interactions with Typically Developing Peers</h5>
<p>This project will focus on designing an educational experience that will mediate social interactions between typical children and children with the autism and autism spectrum disorders. It will focus on the critical social and language skills needed by this group of children. The designed solution will have to consider difficult social, ethical, and physical issues in order meet the needs of typical children and children with autism. You will need to select a target audience between the ages of 6 and 12 years old. The educational experience must be age appropriate and interesting to both the child with autism and to their typical peers. It must not be designed or branded as an “autism” product. It must have some learning outcome that is beneficial to both constituent groups. Your final design should be branded and given a suitable identity for the target audience. You design and prototype all interface, product designs, and other essential elements to demonstrate the functionality of your solution.</p>
