	<h5>Educational Experiences for Children with Autism to Mediate Social and Educational Interactions with Typically Developing Peers</h5>
	<p>This project will focus on designing an educational experience that will mediate social interactions between typical children and children with the autism and autism spectrum disorders. It will focus on the critical social and language skills needed by this group of children. The designed solution will have to consider difficult social, ethical, and physical issues in order meet the needs of typical children and children with autism. You will need to select a target audience between the ages of 6 and 12 years old. The educational experience must be age appropriate and interesting to both the child with autism and to their typical peers. It must not be designed or branded as an “autism” product. It must have some learning outcome that is beneficial to both constituent groups. Your final design should be branded and given a suitable identity for the target audience. You design and prototype all interface, product designs, and other essential elements to demonstrate the functionality of your solution.</p>

	<h6>Objective</h6>
	<p>At the beginning of the game there are six discs suspended in the game wall in an unordered sequence. The objective of the game is to sort these six discs in order of ascending value. Once every disc has been sorted in order then the players have successfully completed a level. After a level has been completed then the discs are reset within the game wall and a new level begins as the buttons in the game panel are updated with more challenging problems. If a team of players is able to progress through all 25 levels then they have mastered the game. (additional levels can be purchased from our online store)</p>
