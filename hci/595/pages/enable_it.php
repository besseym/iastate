<h5>Enabling Designs for Independent Living</h5>
<p>Many people could be more independent and live on their own longer and more safely with the assistance of technology to support them. People with cognitive disabilities, MR, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and the elderly could be supported in a variety of ways such as through memory devices, home monitoring systems, and safety devices. How can creative IT solutions be applied to these technologies to make them emotionally and socially appropriate to enable independent living for persons with chronic illness, cognitive disabilities, and language barriers for the purpose of promoting health, well-being, safety, independent living with regard to daily routines, or augmented communication? Design solutions must consider the social, emotional, physical, and behavioral characteristics and lifestyles of the target audience. The design must also have a style that is high in both desirability and usability.</p>
