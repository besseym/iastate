<h5>Enabling Designs for Independent Living</h5>
<p>Many people could be more independent and live on their own longer and more safely with the assistance of technology to support them. People with cognitive disabilities, MR, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and the elderly could be supported in a variety of ways such as through memory devices, home monitoring systems, and safety devices. How can creative IT solutions be applied to these technologies to make them emotionally and socially appropriate to enable independent living for persons with chronic illness, cognitive disabilities, and language barriers for the purpose of promoting health, well-being, safety, independent living with regard to daily routines, or augmented communication? Design solutions must consider the social, emotional, physical, and behavioral characteristics and lifestyles of the target audience. The design must also have a style that is high in both desirability and usability.</p>

	<p>The purpose of my EnableIT product is to enable a person with diabetes to more easily manage their illness. The design of my product is based on emerging technologies I uncovered in my research. By incorporating these frontier technologies in my design I will explore how to utilize the benefits of these technologies while hopefully identifying and mitigating potential negative effects unproven technologies may have on user experience.</p>

	<p>One goal of my product is to utilize technology to make a patient’s life easier by enabling them to automate the management of their illness. Another goal of my product is to promote healthy choices through equipping the patient with an effortless method to monitor and evaluate the state of their health while protecting the privacy of their data. The final goal of my product is to allow the patient to use the information gathered about their health to augment and facilitate better communication with their caregiver.</p>

	<p>My product consists of a system of devices working together to automatically regulate the patient’s insulin levels and essentially act as an artificial pancreas. The three elements of the system include a glucose sensor, an insulin pocket and a hand held management device that controls the system and provides diagnostic information to the user. The glucose sensor is implanted under the skin and continuously sends glucose readings to the management device every five minutes. Based on the readings received from the glucose sensor, the management device, which is about the size of a smart phone, will instruct the insulin pocket to deliver insulin to the patient.</p>

	<p>The glucose sensor is a bio-implant that, according to my research, could be good for several years before needing to be replaced. The insulin pocket is a waterproof pod that contains everything needed to deliver insulin to the patient including the pump, cannula, needle, and insulin reservoir. The adhesive on the bottom of the insulin pocket allows it be attached virtually anywhere on the body. Once the pocket is attached to the body the user instructs the pump to get into the ready state in which the pump quickly and painlessly inserts the small needle underneath the skin. Now that the pump is in the ready state the management device can be placed into auto-monitor mode in which it receives glucose readings from the glucose sensor and instructs the insulin pump pocket to deliver insulin based on those readings.</p>

	<p>If the management device detects an issue with the system including low levels of insulin in the pump or if it is no longer receiving readings from the glucose sensor then it can notify the user with an indicator icon. If the management device detects a severe issue such as very low or high glucose levels then it can alert the patient to the problem via an alarm. This alarm system will protect the patient while they sleep from dropping into a coma because of low blood sugar levels.</p>

	<p>In addition to automatically receiving glucose readings from the glucose sensor the management device has a test strip port available for the user to manually test their blood. This provides a backup method for the user to monitor their blood in the event that the glucose sensor implant is no-longer working.</p>

	<p>The management device has an LCD touch screen which allows the user to access the history of glucose readings and insulin injections. Also the management device can wirelessly transfer all the data it has recorded to software on a computer. This software can be used to analyze trends in the user’s glucose levels over extended periods of time. Also, this software can securely transfer the data to the patient’s health care provider in order to help guide care.</p>
